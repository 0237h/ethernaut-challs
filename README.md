# ethernaut-challs
A week of headaches and enjoying clicking Metamask's confirmation prompt as part of my smart contracts learning journey.

## What ?

My solutions to the Ethernaut [challenges](ethernaut.openzeppelin.com/) are listed here with each directory containing either a `.sol` smart contract along with its deployement script for the [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/) or a `.js` file to be run within a web3-enabled console.

## How ?

Some nice tools and resources that helped me for solving these challs :
* [Ethereum Virtual Machine Opcodes](https://ethervm.io/)
* [How to read Ethereum contract storage | by Darius | Medium](https://medium.com/@dariusdev/how-to-read-ethereum-contract-storage-44252c8af925)
* [Solidity documentation](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/index.html)
* [Tokens - OpenZeppelin Docs](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/tokens)
* [OpenZeppelin Contracts](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts)

## Next ?

I set my eyes on the [Capture the Ether](https://capturetheether.com/) challenges, see you [there](https://github.com/Krow10/capture-the-ether-challs) !
